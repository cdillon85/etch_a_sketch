# etch_a_sketch

This project was loosely inspired by the Odin Project's jQuery project to create an etch-a-sketch. 

However, I decided that I wanted to create something that mirrored the real thing as much as possible.

As of November 9, the project has some basic functionality: the sketch-pad allows you to draw using a black line and clicking the erase button erases the sketch-pad and causes the etch-a-sketch to "shake" just like the old school toy.

Eventually, I want to add in the ability to draw in different colors and a "surprise" feature where instead of drawing you "erase" the screen to reveal a surprise image.
